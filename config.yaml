# options are one or more of:
# alignments
# calls
# consensus (consensus sequences from calls)
# msa (multiple sequence alignment of all of the consensus seqs in a group)
# tsvs (converts vcf to tsv to easily load calls into R)
output:
  - alignments
  - calls
  - consensus
  - msa
  - tsvs

# how to filter variants
filtering:
    - "QUAL>10" # basic quality filtering
    - "QUAL / FORMAT/AO > 10" # scale quality by depth
    - "FORMAT/DP > 20 & FORMAT/DP < 200" # depth cutoffs
    - "SAF > 0 & SAR > 0" # there must be forward and reverse reads supporting the variant
