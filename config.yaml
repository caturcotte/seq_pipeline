# options are one or more of:
# alignments
# calls
# consensus (consensus sequences from calls)
# msa (multiple sequence alignment of all of the consensus seqs in a group)
# tsvs (converts vcf to tsv to easily load calls into R)
output:
  - alignments
  - calls
  - consensus
  - tsvs

# If location is set to data for paired sample A, snakemake will look for the files:

# how to filter variants
filtering:
  - "QUAL>10"
  # all:
  #   - "QUAL>10" # basic quality filtering
  #   - "FORMAT/DP > 20 & FORMAT/DP < 200" # depth cutoffs
  # bcftools:
  # freebayes:
  #   - "QUAL / FORMAT/AO > 10" # scale quality by depth
  #   - "SAF > 0 & SAR > 0" # there must be forward and reverse reads supporting the variant

bcftools_opts:
  call_as_groups: False
  call_type: "c" #c or m, c is good for sequence of somatic tissue, m is good for detecting variants in low abundance e.g. germline

freebayes_opts:
  chunks: 100 # you shouldn't need to change this
